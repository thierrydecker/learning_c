# Bit Fields

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows:

    struct {
        unsigned int widthValidated;
        unsigned int heightValidated;
    } status;

This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the 
variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.

If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C 
compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as 
follows:

    struct {
        unsigned int widthValidated : 1;
        unsigned int heightValidated : 1;
    } status;

The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the 
values.

If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. 

However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. 
Let us check the following example to understand the concept:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

/* define simple structure */
struct {
        unsigned int widthValidated;
        unsigned int heightValidated;
} status1;

/* define a structure with bit fields */
struct {
        unsigned int widthValidated
                : 1;
        unsigned int heightValidated
                : 1;
} status2;

int main ()
{
        printf ("Memory size occupied by status1 : %d\n", sizeof (status1));
        printf ("Memory size occupied by status2 : %d\n", sizeof (status2));
        return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result âˆ’

```
Memory size occupied by status1 : 8
Memory size occupied by status2 : 4
```

## Bit Field Declaration

The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure:

    struct {
        type [member_name] : width ;
    };

The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field:

- type
 
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
- member_name

The name of the bit-field.

- width

The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.

The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; 
for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 
bits as follows:

    struct {
        unsigned int age : 3;
    } Age;

The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the 
value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. 

Let us try the following example:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct {
        unsigned int age
                : 3;
} Age;

int main ()
{

        Age.age = 4;
        printf ("Sizeof( Age ) : %d\n", sizeof (Age));
        printf ("Age.age : %d\n", Age.age);

        Age.age = 7;
        printf ("Age.age : %d\n", Age.age);

        Age.age = 8;
        printf ("Age.age : %d\n", Age.age);

        return 0;
}
```

When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result:

```
Sizeof( Age ) : 4
Age.age : 4
Age.age : 7
Age.age : 0
```
