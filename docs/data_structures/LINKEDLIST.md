# Linked list

Like arrays, a Linked List is a linear data structure. 

Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

## Why Linked List?

Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.

- The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, 
generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.

- Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements 
and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

For example, in a system, if we maintain a sorted list of IDs in an array `id[]`.

`id[] = [1000, 1010, 1050, 2000, 2040].`

And if we want to insert a new ID 1005, then to maintain the sorted order, we have to move all the elements after 1000 
(excluding 1000).

Deletion is also expensive with arrays until unless some special techniques are used. For example, to delete 1010 in 
id[], everything after 1010 has to be moved.

## Advantages over arrays

- Dynamic size

- Ease of insertion/deletion

## Drawbacks

- Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do 
binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.

- Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.

- Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there 
in case of linked lists.

## Representation

A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If 
the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:

- data

- Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node

In C, we can represent a node using structures. 

Below is an example of a linked list node with integer data.

```
struct Linked_List_Node {
        int data;
        struct Linked_List_Node *next;
}; 
```

First Simple Linked List in C Let us create a simple linked list with 3 nodes.

```
/*
 * A simple C program to introduce a linked list
 * */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/*
 * Declare the Linked_List_Node structure
 * */
struct Linked_List_Node {
        int data;
        struct Linked_List_Node *next;
};

/*
 * Program to create a simple linked list with 3 nodes
 * */
int main ()
{
        /*
         * Declare three pointers to the Linked_List_Node structure type
         * and initialize them to NULL (best practice)
         * */
        struct Linked_List_Node *head = NULL;
        struct Linked_List_Node *second = NULL;
        struct Linked_List_Node *third = NULL;

        /*
         * allocate 3 nodes in the heap
         * */
        head = (struct Linked_List_Node *) malloc (sizeof (struct Linked_List_Node));
        second = (struct Linked_List_Node *) malloc (sizeof (struct Linked_List_Node));
        third = (struct Linked_List_Node *) malloc (sizeof (struct Linked_List_Node));

        /* 
         * Three blocks have been allocated dynamically.
         * We have pointers to these three blocks as head,
         * second and third
         * 
         * Data is random because we havenâ€™t assigned
         * anything yet
         * */

        /*
         * Assign data in first node
         * */
        head->data = 1;

        /*
         * Link first node with the second node
         * */
        head->next = second;
        /*
         * Data has been assigned to the data part of the first
         * block (block pointed by the head). And next
         * pointer of first block points to second.
         * So they both are linked.
         * */

        /*
         * Assign data to second node
         * */
        second->data = 2;

        /*
         * Link second node with the third node
         * */
        second->next = third;

        /*
         * data has been assigned to the data part of the second
         * block (block pointed by second). And next
         * pointer of the second block points to the third
         * block. So all three blocks are linked.
         * */

        third->data = 3; // assign data to third node
        third->next = NULL;

        /*
         * data has been assigned to data part of third
         * block (block pointed by third). And next pointer
         * of the third block is made NULL to indicate
         * that the linked list is terminated here.
         *
         * Note that only head is sufficient to represent
         * the whole list. We can traverse the complete
         * list by following next pointers.
         * */

        return 0;
}
 
```

## Linked List Traversal

In the previous program, we have created a simple linked list with three nodes. Let us traverse the created list and 
print the data of each node. For traversal, let us write a general-purpose function printList() that prints any given 
list.

**_linked_list.h files:_**

```
#ifndef LINKED_LIST_H
#define LINKED_LIST_H

struct Linked_List_Node {
        int data;
        struct Linked_List_Node *next;
};

void linked_list (void);
void print_list (struct Linked_List_Node *n);

#endif
```

**_linked_list.c files:_**

```
#include "linked_list.h"

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/*
 * Call functions
 * */
void linked_list (void)
{
        struct Linked_List_Node *head = NULL;
        struct Linked_List_Node *second = NULL;
        struct Linked_List_Node *third = NULL;

        head = (struct Linked_List_Node *) malloc (sizeof (struct Linked_List_Node));
        second = (struct Linked_List_Node *) malloc (sizeof (struct Linked_List_Node));
        third = (struct Linked_List_Node *) malloc (sizeof (struct Linked_List_Node));

        head->data = 100;
        head->next = second;

        second->data = 200;
        second->next = third;

        third->data = 300;
        third->next = NULL;

        print_list (head);
}

/*
 * Print any given list
 * */
void print_list (struct Linked_List_Node *n)
{
        int i = 0;
        while (n != NULL) {
                printf ("(%d) Data: %d\n", i, n->data);
                n = n->next;
                i++;
        }
}
```

**_main.c file:_**

```
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "linked_list.h"

/*
 * Main function
 * */
int main (int argv, char *args[])
{


        linked_list ();

        return EXIT_SUCCESS;

}
```

The execution of the program below gives us:

```
(0) Data: 100
(1) Data: 200
(2) Data: 300
```

## Inserting a node

We have introduced Linked Lists in the previous paragraphs. 

We also created a simple linked list with 3 nodes and discussed linked list traversal.

All programs discussed in this post consider following representations of linked list:

```
struct Linked_List_Node {
        int data;
        struct Linked_List_Node *next;
};
```

In this post, methods to insert a new node in linked list are discussed. 

A node can be added in three ways:

- At the front of the linked list
- After a given node.
- At the end of the linked list.

### Add a node at the front: (A 4 steps process)

The new node is always added before the head of the given Linked List. 

And newly added node becomes the new head of the Linked List. 

For example if the given Linked List is 10->15->20->25 and we add an item 5 at the front, then the Linked List becomes 
5->10->15->20->25. 

Let us call the function that adds at the front of the list is push(). 

The push() must receive a pointer to the head pointer, because push must change the head pointer to point to the new 
node (See this)

![Linked list](../images/Linkedlist_insert_at_start.png)

- **_Step 1:_** 

    Allocate node.

- **_Step 2:_**

    Put data in the node.
    
- **_Step 3:_**

    Make next of new node as head.
    
- **_Step 4:_**

    Move the head to point to the new node.
